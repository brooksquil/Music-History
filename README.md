# Music History 2

Requirements

Use JavaScript arrays, loops, and innerHTML to show the music you love.

Use JavaScript to create a list of songs in the index.html file for your Music History project. Download the songs.js file, which contains an array of strings with song information.

Add one song to the beginning and the end of the array.
Loop over the array, and remove any words or characters that obviously don't belong.
Find and replace the > character in each item with a - character.
Add each string to the DOM in index.html in the main content area.
Example output:

{Song name} by {Artist} on the album {Album}

{Song name} by {Artist} on the album {Album}
